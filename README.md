# ENHANCED-TDMRC
E-TDMRC (Enhanced Time-Divided Multi-Round Cipher) is a lightweight Verilog-based encryption algorithm using nonlinear congruential generators (NLCG) and modular key mixing. This reduced 5-byte version encrypts input using dynamic subkeys and outputs a 40-bit cipher and decrypted result.
